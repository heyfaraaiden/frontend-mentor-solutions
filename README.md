# frontend-mentor-solutions
Hi, welcome! ðŸ‘‹  
This repo contains my personal solutions for Frontend Mentor Challenges.  
I will keep updating this repo in my free time ðŸ˜„  

## What I want to achieve
By doing these challenges, I want to train myself in slicing designs to codes.  
It's not that easy to convert designs from pictures to codes precisely, especially for these free challenges because I have no access to Figma/Sketch design file.  
But I will try to code so they will have looks as close as possible to the design.
